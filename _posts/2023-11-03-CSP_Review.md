# College Board MC
- REALLY long
- Pacing
- 60/66 :(

### - Problem 14:
- one such mistake in which I didn't read one of the answers
- On the problem, it asked us to compare two loops and analyze what is different between the two programs
- I selected that they display different number values but didn't select that the values themselves are different because I didn't see that as an option

### - Problem 30 :
- Another mistake in which I didn't thoroughly read the program at question
- I think this was due to how long the test was
- Something I can do to fix this for the future will be to slow down a bit in the beginning since I went rather fast in the beginning and got a bit tired

Towards the end of the test I began losing focus and because of that, I got almost 4 questions wrong in a row for misreading and misunderstanding questions.

The main takeaway for me from this test is to pace myself during future tests
