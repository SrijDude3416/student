Question 1:
parallel computing is where there are simultaneous processes occurring to increase the speed of computation.
Question 2:
The program will finish after 632ms because the program is only as fast as its slowest core
Question 3:
Parallel computing is more efficient because it allows for multiple computations to occur simulataneously
Question 4:
network redundancy/path redundancy
Question 5:
Yes, the network is fault tolerant because there are multiple paths for packets to travel to nodes.
