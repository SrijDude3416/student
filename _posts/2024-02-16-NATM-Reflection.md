# GLOW and GROWS

Some CSA students provided feedback suggesting the incorporation of additional features to enhance button customization, thereby improving the overall quality of the site. They also recommended refining the SASS and design elements for a more polished appearance. Additionally, they expressed a desire for a feature enabling users to alter button shapes, such as adopting circular or alternative geometries.

Another suggestion from reviewers was to streamline the process of modifying user profiles, making it more intuitive and akin to conventional website interfaces where the profile edit button is seamlessly integrated with the user's profile picture.

Similar sentiments were echoed by both CSA students and parents who visited our booth. They appreciated the website's potential, particularly its sophisticated login systems allowing users to adjust profile pictures and other details. Furthermore, they commended the customizable design options, which permit users to save designs to the database as public or private. The search function and robust backend implementation were also lauded.

## From feedback, what is something you will add to individual CPT project-

From this feedback, I'll probably be adding a drop shadow element to edit on the frontend and store in the backend
so that there are more customizable options for users to play around with. 

Here are some image highlights from the night and some projects we went around and saw. Overall, the night was quite fun!
