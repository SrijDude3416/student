<h1>Who am I?</h1>

Hey, I'm Srijan! I'm a current sophomore attending Del Norte High School and an aspring computer scientist. 


I've been programming for almost six years now and have experience with programming in python, have dabbled with C(#/++), and am currently working on making full-stack web apps (more later!). 


I enjoy making, breaking, and rebuilding things and as such, I love Cyber Security. I currently compete in the CyberPatriot competition and won the Cypat XIV National Finals. 


I'm also a machine learning enthusiast and am extremely well-versed in Computer Vision and currently looking into diffusion models and their various possible industry applications (past what they're being used in right now, of course).

<p>Here's a <a href="/student//2023/08/29/About_Me_Quiz_IPYNB_2_.html"> quiz </a> to test what you learned about me!</p>
