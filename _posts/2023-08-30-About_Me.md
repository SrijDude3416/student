<h1>Who am I?</h1>

Hey, I'm Srijan! I'm a current sophomore attending Del Norte High School and an aspring computer scientist. 


I enjoy making, breaking, and rebuilding things and as such I love Cyber Security. I currently compete in the CyberPatriot competition and won the Cypat XIV National Finals.
