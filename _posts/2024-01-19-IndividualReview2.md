## First half of Tri 2 of AP CSP

The first half of tri 2 of AP Comp Sci was pretty eventful. In the Binary CPT project I did, I was responsible for the creation of numerous steganography tools for embedding images within other images. I learned a lot about masks and mask logic. I additionally plan on making a blog post detailing the things I did.

Looking forward to tri 2, I am excited to create numerous canvas element based tools that involve frontend and javascript since last trimester I was responsible for backend. I've already begun experimenting with canvas and javascript mouse pointer data reading.
